# Business-Case-Establishing-a-Cybersecurity-Policy-Framework-at-NovaSphere
NovaSphere Technologies began modernizing its digital ecosystem by expanding cloud services, automating workflows, and increasing online offerings. 
These improvements brought gains in efficiency,
but they also opened new exposure points. Internal reviews revealed inconsistent security practices
and the absence of formal policies for access control, data protection, incident response, and vendor
oversight.
NovaSphere created the role of Cybersecurity Risk Manager and tasked me with developing the
company’s first cybersecurity policy framework. This initiative aims to reduce operational risk,
strengthen accountability, and align with standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and CIS controls
